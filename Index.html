    <h1><center>GIT</center></h1> <hr>
    <p><center> Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes <br> in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work <br> among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software <br> development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for <br> distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches <br> running on different computers)</center></p>
